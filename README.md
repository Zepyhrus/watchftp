# watchftp

This is a simple demo of a ftp watcher, takes function:
* Watch file changed on specified directory on ftp;
* if new files are added, then do something to the new added files and save 
  them back to another destination foled on the ftp; 
* Currently, no further monitoring functions are needed, like file removing 
  and so no; 
* Will be added in the future.
